# je-model

je-model is a "Just enough Javascript Model"

## What does it do?
je-model is a tiny library that simplifies the usage of models in Javascript

## Goals of this project
- To squeeze in as much functionality as possible in a tiny object wrapper 
- Be very generic and not very opiniated
- Support nested models/objects and arrays since I often work with useless third party API's that I don't have control over.
- Super flexible and modularized code
- Lazy evaluate data. No need to calculate things every single time (Backbone.NestedModel *nudge nudge*)
- Experiment with a great gulp TDD workflow (derived from my framework "Lilly" - named after my daughter)
- Zero external dependencies. It should just work.
- Work with latest Chrome/Firefox/Webkit/node/PhantomJS/<insert random useful javascript parser> in desktop/tablets/mobiles and hopefully IE9+ (IE8 - eat my liver!)

## What is NOT the goals of this project
- Become the new ActiveRecords
- Become bloated
- Solve world crisis and starvation
- Become the fastest library on the planet. Use memoization if you need to send a rocket to the moon.
- Support shitty non-modern browsers (I've worked with the web ~15 years, no more wasting time supporting IE 5.5 and Netscape 4.7)

## Why another Javascript Model library?
- Because I like nesting objects with metadata
- Because sometimes I also need a flattened structure
- Because I don't want to sacrify performance for developer ergonomics.
- Because I love Ruby collections
- Because computed properties are so god damn convenient.
- Because I love simplicify of quering with LINQ/MongoDB/SQL
- Because angels cries and kittens suffers when they see the elvis operator in non-library code
- Because I like the simplicity of Backbone.Model but curse at it's shortcomings.
- Because I've spent too much time debugging Backbone.NestedModel
- Because Open Source is awesome.
- Because Lodash & underscore have become bloated
- Because I haven't found a good generic Javascript Model that suited my needs.
- Because writing good API's seems to be a lost art.
- Because js-model doesn't seem very active.
- Because I love using LiveScript
- Because I lost faith in maintaining old legacy browsers
- List goes on ....
